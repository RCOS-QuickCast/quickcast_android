# Quickcast

Quickcast is an open source Android application for viewing e-sports scores being developed by a team of Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) students.

Our current goal is to reach functionality for DOTA 2 while keeping our server and app system flexible enough to add other sports in the future.

*Resources and technologies we are working with include:*

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Json
- Android Studio
